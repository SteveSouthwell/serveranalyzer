Server Analyzer
by S.E. Southwell - Progress Software
This is not an officially supported tool of Progress Software.  It is meant to supplement, not replace the tools in OEManager, oejmx, and the rest interface.

It was designed to help you view and manage persistent procedures that may be supered or orphaned on your server, using up memory.

To install:
Take the contents of the server directory, and place all 3 files somewhere in your propath on your PASOE ABLApp.  
You can put them in WEB-INF/openedge or any other place that makes sense.

Run the .w from a Progress session such as PDSOE or AppBuilder.
